%description
Minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++.

Designed for high performance. Suitable for writing zero copy parsers
and encoders with minimal need for run-time allocation of memory.

Low-level: this is designed to be a building block for writing a
very customized decoder for a stable protobuf schema. If your protobuf
schema is changing frequently or lazy decoding is not critical for your
application then this approach offers no value: just use the decoding
API available via the C++ API that can be generated via the Google
Protobufs protoc program.
