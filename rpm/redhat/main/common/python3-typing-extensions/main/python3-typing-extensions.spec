%description
The `typing_extensions` module serves two related purposes:

- Enable use of new type system features on older Python versions. For example,
  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows
  users on previous Python versions to use it too.
- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and
  added to the `typing` module.

`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as
mypy and pyright. Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same
way as equivalent forms in `typing`.

`typing_extensions` uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The
major version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.
Therefore, it's safe to depend
on `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,
where `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.

`typing_extensions` supports Python versions 3.7 and higher.
