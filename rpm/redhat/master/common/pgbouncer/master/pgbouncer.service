# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/pgbouncer.service",

#       .include /lib/systemd/system/pgbouncer.service
#       ...make your changes here...
